# Digital Resume

## About the project

I once had an idea for digitalizing the resume. The idea is to create a more interactive resume, with the focus on first making it easy for the reader to see the relevant information quickly, and then, being able to look for more information.

This is still a work-in-progress, as a regular PDF would probably give a more quick overview, as you won't have to click for individual parts to appear.

## Code structure

The code is made with React and entirely front-end. The folder "src/data" is structured in a way that it would be easily transferable to a back-end structure, potentially making use of a database. Right now, the data is stored in JSON format, but the file itself "/src/data/resumeData.js" is left out. You can still view the transformation of the data in "resumeDataApplied.js".
